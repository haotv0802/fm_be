- Naming package, class, method, etc
    - Package name should be noun and in lowercase.
    - Class name should be a noun and with First letter of a word in uppercase.
    - Method is an action, so name it like: getSomething, handleSomething, doSomething.


- Write unit test
    - Make the class under the package named the same with tested class.
        for example: we make a test for MoneyFlowResource in package: fm.api.rest.moneyflow
                    we should make a new test class: MoneyFlowResourceTest in package fm.api.rest.moneyflow in test section

- Do validation at Resource layer

- Do NOT do any business logic in Resource layer

- Do business at Service layer

- Do NOT do any business at DAO layer (or in case we have to do that, just minimize as much as possible by doing it in Service layer)
